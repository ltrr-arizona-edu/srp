            Why should there be a relationship between streamflow and tree 
            growth in the arid and semi-arid western United States?</b></font><br>
            <br>
            Tree growth can be limited if there is not sufficient moisture in 
            the soil. This can arise from either a lack of precipitation, or 
            excessive evapotranspiration in warm, dry climates-- or both. 
            Regionally, precipitation minus evaporation determines the amount of 
            runoff available in rivers and streams. Hence both trees and streams 
            can respond to weather and climate patterns that produce sustained 
            drought condition. In the project study areas, the snow that falls 
            in the winter prior to a tree's growing season is reflected in the 
            tree's growth in spring and summer via soil moisture storage.<br>

            How good are the tree-ring based reconstructions of flow when 
            compared to the gaged record?</b></font><br>
            <br>
            The reconstructions track the timing of high and low flow years 
            quite well and do a good job of capturing the magnitudes of the 
            flow, especially in the dry years. The reconstruction models explain 
            77.4 % of the variance for the Colorado at Lees Ferry (r = 0.88) and 
            57.8 % of the variance for the Salt-Verde-Tonto (r = 0.76). The 
            magnitudes of extreme wet years are reconstructed more accurately in 
            the large Colorado basin than in the Salt-Verde-Tonto basin, in part 
            because of the latter smaller basin’s “flashier” streamflow. <br>

            <br>
            In both basins, the mean of the observed period is higher than the 
            longterm reconstructed mean. This indicates that, in general, the 
            20th century has been wetter in both basins than in previous 
            centuries. (The recent drought years of the late 1990s and early 
            2000’s were not included in this analysis, however, and their

            What are the implications of the project results?<br>
            <br>
            </b></font>A widely held working hypothesis is that the Upper 
            Colorado River Basin (UCRB) can serve as a buffer to compensate for 
            extreme low flow in the Salt-Verde-Tonto Basin during drought 
            periods. One reason this is plausible is because of the size of the 
            UCRB basin and the overall magnitude of its discharge. It has also 
            been assumed that streamflows in the two river systems are 
            relatively independent of each other due to a difference in the 
            climatic regimes influencing each basin.<br>
            <br>
            While the above presumptions sound logical, our analysis did not 
            substantiate them. We found that the simple correlation between the 
            annual flow values of the two 444-year reconstructed time series was 
            r = .599 ( r
            </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><sup>2</sup></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> = 0.359), which is a statistically significant 
            correlation, given the large sample size. Far more compelling with 
            respect to extreme events, however, was the overwhelming dominance 
            of HH and LL events in comparison to extremes where the basins 
            responded in the opposite direction.<br>
            <br>
            These results suggest that <b>annual streamflow variability in the 
            Salt-Verde Basin – especially extreme streamflow – is not 
            independent of annual streamflow variability in the Colorado Basin</b>. 
            Therefore it is not unlikely that severe drought in one basin will 
            be accompanied by severe drought in the other basin, such as has 
            occurred during the western drought scenario of the late 1990s and 
            early 2000’s. It should be noted that the immense water supply of 
            the large Upper Colorado basin may allow it to continue to serve as 
            a buffer even when it is in a low flow scenario because a little 
            flow can go a long way in a smaller watersheds such as the 
            Salt-Verde-Tonto, however ever-increasing demand on the water supply 
            of the UCRB by many stakeholders is likely to reduce the size of 
            this buffer in the future.<br>

            It is possible that if the number of wet extreme years is about

            flow will persist, placing more of a burden on water systems 
            management and operations. In other words, <b>reservoir storage can 
            buffer water supplies in the Upper Colorado River Basin and

            by chance. For example, for the 7-year moving average, the Lees 
            Ferry reconstruction and SVT were simultaneously below their drought 
            thresholds in 62 years, which is far more than expected by chance: 
            the Monte Carlo tally indicates the probability is of fewer than 50 
            LL events if the flows on the Colorado and the SVT are unrelated. 
            The expected number of chance events, given by the probability point

            labeled ) has a greater than 0.001 probability of occurring by

            Seasonal composites of upper level (500 mb geopotential height) 
            circulation anomalies for each type of extreme event scenario (based 
            on the observed record) are shown in these two

            characteristic circulation pattern for LL events is 
            higher-than-normal upper level pressure over the west in early 
            winter (Oct -Dec) and over the North Pacific ocean storm track 
            region in mid- to late winter (Jan - Mar). The inverse of this 
            pattern leads to HH events.&nbsp; LH and HL scenarios arise when the 
            Pacific storm track appears to shift to an anomalous poleward (HL) 
            or equatorward (LH) location.<br>

            Is the recent drought in the Salt-Verde Basin unprecedented in 
            severity?<br>
            </b></font><br>
            The annual flows of the basin decreased beginning in water-year 1994 
            and <b>culminated in single-year flows for 2000 and 2002 lower than 
            any previously experienced in the observed record</b> (<a target="_blank" href="faq_figures.htm#context1">FIGURE,</a> 
            top left). The 5-year, 11-year and 15-year running means reached 
            their recent low points in the periods ending with water year 2004.
            <b>As a 5-year running mean, the recent drought is about as severe 
            as the lowest-flow period in the 1950s. </b>The same is true of the 
            11-year running mean, suggesting that the period commencing with the 
            decline in water year 1994 and continuing through water year 2004 
            ranks with the driest conditions in the entire gaged record. When 
            the running mean is extended to 15 years (<a target="_blank" href="faq_figures.htm#context1">FIGURE,</a> 
            lower right), the recent drought no longer ranks among the most 
            severe; the reason for this is the wet sequence of years in the 
            early 1990s enters the moving average. But up to an averaging period 
            of 11 years, it appears the recent drought is at least comparable in 
            severity to any earlier drought in the gaged record.<br>
            <br>
            The tree-ring reconstruction for the Salt+Verde+Tonto (SVT) ends in 
            1988, and so does not cover the recent drought. Nevertheless that 
            reconstruction does sample the 1950s drought, and because the 1950s 
            drought was characterized by flow departure of roughly the same 
            magnitude as the recent drought, we can use the lowest reconstructed 
            flows of the 1950s to indirectly evaluate the relative severity of 
            the recent drought in the context of the reconstruction to A.D. 
            1199.<br>
            <br>
            A plot of 11-year running means of the SVT reconstruction with the 
            baseline marked as the low point in the 1950s suggests that the 
            current drought was exceeded in severity several times in the past 
            800 years (<a href="faq_figures.htm#context2">FIGURE</a>). <b>Eight 
            distinct periods before the start of the gaged record show lower 
            11-year mean flow than the lowest reconstructed value of the 1950s.</b> 
            The<b> most severe of the tree-ring droughts</b> was in the <b>late 
            1500s</b>, during the well-documented “mega-drought” of North 
            America, when 11-year average flow is reconstructed about 100 cfs 
            below the lowest flows of the 1950s. <br>
            <br>
            <b>BOTTOM LINE:&nbsp; The recent drought, while severe, does not 
            appear to be unprecedented when viewed in a multi-century context.<br>
            </b><br>
